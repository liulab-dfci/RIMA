To run the RIMA preprocess modules, in execution.yaml, set preprocess_individual and preprocess_cohort to true. The individual run of the preprocess module includes read alignment, quality checks and gene quantification. The cohort run of the preprocess module will merge data from all samples to produce cohort level reports for alignment, quality metrics and gene quantification. The cohort run will also conduct batch effect removal. ## execution.yaml ## preprocess_individual: true preprocess_cohort: true 2.1 Read Alignment Align reads with STAR STAR is one of the most common tools used for bulk RNA-seq data alignment to generate transcriptome BAM or genomic BAM output, which can be downloaded at here. A tutorial for STAR is available here. When using STAR, the first step is to create a genome index. In our RIMA pipeline, we download the human genome (hg38) STAR index from Genomic Data Commons (GDC) .Let’s use sample SRR8281218 as an example. RIMA runs STAR using the following command structure: STAR --runThreadN 4 --genomeDir ./ref_files/v22 --outReadsUnmapped None --chimSegmentMin 12 --chimJunctionOverhangMin 12 --chimOutJunctionFormat 1 --alignSJDBoverhangMin 10 --alignMatesGapMax 1000000 --alignIntronMax 1000000 --alignSJstitchMismatchNmax 5 -1 5 5 --outSAMstrandField intronMotif --outSAMunmapped Within --outSAMtype BAM Unsorted --readFilesIn {input} --chimMultimapScoreRange 10 --chimMultimapNmax 10 --chimNonchimScoreDropMin 10 --peOverlapNbasesMin 12 --peOverlapMMp 0.1 --genomeLoad NoSharedMemory --outSAMheaderHD @HD VN:1.4 --outFileNamePrefix {params.prefix} --quantMode TranscriptomeSAM RIMA renames the read aligment outputs according to sample id. analysis/star/SRR8281218/SRR8281218.sorted.bam analysis/star/SRR8281218/SRR8281218.transcriptome.bam analysis/star/SRR8281218/SRR8281218.Chimeric.out.junction analysis/star/SRR8281218/SRR8281218.Log.final.out RIMA also uses samtools to generate statistics from the alignment BAM file: samtools stats analysis/star/SRR828121/SRR8281218.sorted.bam | grep ^SN | cut -f 2- &gt; analysis/star/SRR8281218/SRR8281218.sorted.bam.stat.txt Merging the STAR alignment reports After the individual alignment runs of each sample, RIMA will merge the alignment reports from all samples to generate a file named STAR_Align_Report.csv.

An RseQC tutorial is available here. To reduce running time, we first sub-sample sorted BAM files to be used by RseQC to assess alignment quality. If parameter ‘rseqc_ref’ is set to ‘house_keeping’, RIMA will extract alignments of house keeping genes for the sub-sample. ## Example of subsampling 50% of input alignments samtools view -s 0.5 -b analysis/star/SRR8281218/SRR8281218.sorted.bam &gt; analysis/star/SRR8281218/SRR8281218_downsampling.bam # Extract the alignment of housekeeping genes. bedtools intersect -a analysis/star/SRR8281218/SRR8281218_downsampling.bam -b ./ref_files/housekeeping_refseqGenes.bed &gt; analysis/star/SRR8281218/SRR8281218_downsampling_housekeeping.bam # index BAM samtools index analysis/star/SRR8281218/SRR8281218_downsampling_housekeeping.bam &gt; analysis/star/SRR8281218/SRR8281218_downsampling_housekeeping.bam.bai RseQC Quality metrics Transcript integrity number (TIN) is the most widely used measure of RNA integrity, which is the percentage of transcripts that have uniform read coverage across the genome. RseQC calculates the TIN of each transcript and reports mean TIN, median TIN and standard deviation for all transcripts in a sample. The median TIN score (medTIN) across all transcripts is commonly used to indicate the RNA integrity of each sample. Read distribution summarizes the fraction of reads aligned into different genomic regions, such as exon and intron regions. Gene body coverage shows the RNA-seq read coverage over the gene body. Low quality samples have low alignment fractions, low integrity (median TIN) and/or abnormal read distributions and should be removed in downstream analysis. Merge quality metrics RIMA will also merge quality metrics for all samples.

Below is an example of geneBodyCoverage.curves.png: Figure 2.1: Gene Body Coverage Curves 2.3 Gene quantification After the alignment of sequencing reads and quality checks, we quantify the gene or transcript expression from the BAM files.Both Salmon and RSEM are widely used for gene quantification. Salmon conducts fast transcript-level quantification, and RSEM performs both gene-level and transcript-level quantification. Salmon is usually faster and less memory-consuming than RSEM. RSEM generates transcripts per million (TPM), reads per kilobase of exon model (transcript) per million mapped reads (RPKM) and fragments per kilobase of exon model (transcript) per million mapped reads (FPKM) expression. Salmon provides TPMs as a part of its output. All three measures (TPM, RPKM, FPKM) are normalization methods that account for both sequencing depth and gene lengths. (Longer transcripts will have more reads.) TPM is currently thought to be the best method to normalize gene counts. HTSeq quantifies gene expression according to mapped read counts. Both normalized gene expression and raw read counts can be used for differential expression analysis. RIMA uses Salmon for gene quantification. The transcriptome alignment result from STAR is used as the Salmon input: salmon quant -t ./ref_files/salmon_gdc_index/gencode.v22.ts.fa -l A -a analysis/star/SRR8281218/SRR8281218.transcriptome.bam -o analysis/salmon/SRR8281218 The following is an example of an output file from Salmon Name Length EffectiveLength TPM NumReads ENST00000456328.2 1657 1474.085 0.000000 0.000 ENST00000450305.2 632 449.595 0.000000 0.000 ENST00000488147.1 1351 1168.085 7.412619 139.959 ENST00000619216.1 68 69.000 0.000000 0.000 ENST00000473358.1 712 529.382 0.000000 0.000 ENST00000469289.1 535 353.431 0.000000 0.000 ENST00000607096.1 138 16.202 0.000000 0.000 RIMA then uses ‘tximport’ from the DESeq2 R package to combine a cohort’s gene level TPMs into a summary file: ## First 10 rows of merge TPMs ## SRR8281218,SRR8281219,SRR8281226,SRR8281236,SRR8281233,SRR8281230,SRR8281244,SRR8281245,SRR8281243,SRR8281238,SRR8281251,SRR8281250 5_8S_rRNA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 5S_rRNA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 7SK,0,0.75,1,5.864,5.667,5,1.961,2.67,10.47,3.531,5,2.981 A1BG,98.378,248.265,222.032,106.318,159.868,262.034,210.18,157.196,83.865,137.558,130.693,193.207 A1BG-AS1,82.273,252.763,70.572,80.758,100.73,297.316,119.662,145.835,66.107,59.74,90.452,168.508 A1CF,2,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,196 A2M,14326.273,9018.603,27465.295,22061.332,31646.181,4559.962,14865.119,20065.994,30592.578,19598.148,12355.795,7203.953 A2M-AS1,59.728,6.397,12.704,36.667,52.819,4.038,24.881,13.006,34.423,23.852,6.206,25.047 A2ML1,180.001,0,17,42,83,55,93,0,12,10,9,763.998 A2ML1-AS1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.506,0,0 2.4 Batch effect removal Batch effects across samples are easily overlooked but worth considering for immunotherapy cohort studies. Batch effects are usually caused by unbalanced experimental design and confound the estimation of group differences. For example, samples processed at different facilities may have sequencing differences that are not due to actual biological differences in the samples themselves. To avoid confounding actual biological variation with the effects of experimental design, limma and Combat are common approaches to correct batch effects. Limma uses a two-way ANOVA approach. Combat uses an empirical Bayes approach, which is critical for small batches to avoid over-correction. For large batches, both methods should be similar. The sva R package integrates both methods for batch effect correction. Principal components analysis (PCA) or unsupervised clustering before and after batch effect removal is an excellent way to validate that a batch effect has been removed. To evaluate if your samples have a batch effect, RIMA will generate PCA plots of gene expression data before and after batch effect removal by limma. To utilize this feature, modify the “batch” parameter in the config.yaml file for your run. Example of PCA before and after batch correction using limma. (Note: No batch effect was found in the original data used for this tutorial. To generate this diagram, we added a ‘syn_batch’ column to the metasheet for demonstration purposes.)
